# LLM-Powered Maintenance Log Analysis & Digital Twin Forecasting for Smart Factories

This project explores the integration of Large Language Models (LLMs) with predictive maintenance and digital twin concepts to enhance intelligent factory management. It aims to analyze unstructured maintenance logs using LLMs and generate failure forecasts, even in the absence of real-world sensor data.

## üöÄ Project Objectives

- Use LLMs (e.g., GPT-4) to interpret free-text maintenance notes and categorize failure causes
- Simulate a digital twin response to past log patterns and predict future failures
- Develop a modular system that is extensible to real-time factory operations

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used

- Python 3.10+
- [LangChain](https://github.com/hwchase17/langchain)
- OpenAI GPT-4 API or Hugging Face LLMs
- pandas, scikit-learn
- Optional: FAISS, PyTorch, Streamlit (for future roadmap)

## üß† Key Components

- `sample_logs.csv`: Simulated maintenance logs for testing
- `llm_log_parser.py`: Main script for LLM-powered log interpretation
- `forecast_model.py`: Predictive model (TBD: LSTM or rule-based estimator)
- `notebooks/`: Jupyter notebooks for experimentation
